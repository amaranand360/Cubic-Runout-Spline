# Cubic Runout Spline Interpolation

## Overview
This repository contains a C implementation of the Cubic Runout Spline interpolation algorithm. The algorithm is designed to interpolate values between given data points with the most extreme endpoint behavior.

## Design Choices
- The code follows standard C conventions.
- Input data is taken from the user, and the spline interpolation is performed accordingly.
- Memory allocation is handled using dynamic memory allocation.

## Usage
- The `main` function takes user input for data points and performs spline interpolation.
- Continuous input is accepted until the user decides to exit.

## Dependencies
- The code does not use any external libraries.

## How to Build and Run
- Compile the code using a C compiler.
- Run the executable to interactively input data points and perform spline interpolation.
